## Machine learning, statistical learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence

The aim of this research is to understand which are the elements that 
mostly affect the instructional expenditure per student of the US colleges presented in
the data. In order to perform this task, the research exploits two important supervised
methods: the multiple linear regression and the regression tree. Furthermore, some
more sophisticated models are implemented both in the linear regression framework
and on the tree-based method, in order to make the analysis more complete and to
reach higher performance. With regard to the multiple linear regression, a study of
the multi-collinearity is done in order to ruled out predictors that are too correlated to
each other; polynomial regression is implemented so to understand if some non-linear
models could perform better on the data; model selection is applied exploiting a shrinkage method, the so called Lasso, in order to simplify the model and to consequently
increase its predictive power. With respect to the tree-based methods, the basic regression tree is pruned in order to reduce overfitting on the dataset; furthermore, using
the random forest technique, the predictive power of the model is increased.
